How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It was actually fun. I was not aware of such a beautiful command. It feels like i have
learnt something. cheers !!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
By doing so, i will have access to all my previous versions and it will be helpful in debugging my code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
It's always good to choose commits manually since human brains are more intelligent than machines ;)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
github allows it because it mostly deals with source code, where one files are dependent in each other, whereas
rest of the systems aren't dealing with source code, they dont need to do so.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
I can pretty much do everything using the two commands, one allows me to view the commit history and
another allows me to compare two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
With version control in practice, i dont have to undo things to find bugs in my program. Its really easy to
find bugs with version control.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I would use git to keep track of all my projects that i do.
