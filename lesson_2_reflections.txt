What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The new directory called .git is created which contains metadata about the versions.
it is hidden as it has a period in beginning of the filename.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It kind of operates like a buffer, a single unit which has files to be committed at once.
