When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i am outstation and dont have access to my computer, i would want it to be in some remote repository 
and i can work on it from wherever i want.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I would know when i make changes online and whether or not i want them in my computer, so its good to manually pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would have to mail my code to my friend in order for him to edit it and wait till i get his version.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
whenever i want my updates to be checked by others ill create a branch and push it. ill then create a pull request in
