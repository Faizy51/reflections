When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i am outstation and dont have access to my computer, i would want it to be in some remote repository 
and i can work on it from wherever i want.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I would know when i make changes online and whether or not i want them in my computer, so its good to manually pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork is cloning from github to github, clone is copying from github to local computer and banch used is when u want to add a new
feature or expriment with the project. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
we can pretty well track the status of commits on our local machine and the repository.
